# TeamFinder

This platform's purpose:

- to connect individuals with teams that have room for more members
- to help teams looking for prospective members be proactive and search for interested people

## Origin Story
The inspiration for building TeamFinder came from a personal experience during my college days.

- I once planned to participate in a hackathon hosted by my college.

- But my close friends were either out of town or uninterested in joining. 

- Discouraged by the lack of a team, I ended up not going. 

- Only to later realize that some of my high school acquaintances had attended with teams smaller than the allowed size.

TeamFinder aims to ensure that no one misses out on valuable opportunities just because they couldnâ€™t form a team with people within their friend group.
